Have you ever looked for a dimension mod that lets you build, create pixel art, or create things with Chisel & Bits?
Or are you a player who creates more and more worlds and ends up losing track of where things are?
Here's the answer. Builders Dimension generates a dimension with a white block. (Very simple) 
It's the best way to create pixel art with Chisel & Bits and buildings for servers and maps. 
You can access the dimension by building the portal or using a portal mod. 
I recommend creating the portal or using the Star Gate mod. 


- Spawning Portals in Overworld is very rare.
- Disabling the mod is easy. All you have to do is prohibit the creation of the portal tool.
- With the StarGate* mod, you can connect all dimensions, maps, or servers with a single gate structure.


**How to Install?**

- Like normal mod installation.
